# About this App

This is a simple, intuitive social media platform aimed at solving the problems associated with modern social media, such as anxiety, FOMO, and distraction. Our goal is to create a platform that promotes meaningful connections and positive social experiences, while minimizing the negative effects that can come with excessive social media use.

### Our App's Unique Features

Our social media platform has several unique features that we believe set us apart from other platforms:

1. **Text-Based Posts**: Many social media platforms today focus on short-form video content, which can be addictive and make it difficult to engage with information on a deeper level. To promote a slower, more deliberate form of social interaction, we've chosen to focus on text-based posts.

2. **Notification-Free Experience**: Modern social media platforms are often filled with distracting notifications, from new message alerts to updates about popular posts. We've removed these notifications from our app to allow users to focus on the content and people they care about.

3. **Decentralized Platform**: Most large social media platforms today are centralized, which can lead to issues with censorship and content moderation. We've taken a decentralized approach, allowing for greater freedom of expression and speech.

4. **Mood Selection**: Our app allows users to filter their feed based on their current mood. This feature helps users find content and connect with others who are going through similar experiences, whether it's a happy moment worth sharing or a difficult time that requires support and understanding.

At the core of our app is a commitment to promoting healthy, meaningful social interactions. We believe that social media can be a powerful tool for bringing people together, and we're dedicated to creating a platform that reflects these values.

Thank you for choosing our app, and we look forward to helping you connect with others and share your experiences in a positive and meaningful way.
